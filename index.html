        <p>      Hello there! My name is Fanyi Qian, but most of my friends call me Jasmine since I've been using this name for over 10 years. As a Libra, I've always been fascinated by art and its power to express emotions and ideas. After obtaining my degree in Art History from the university a few years ago, I decided to come to Algonquin College to explore the field of interactive media design. As an international student, I'm so excited to be here in Canada, meeting new people from all over the world and starting a new chapter in my life for a career change.

Here are some fun facts about me:

I've travelled to nine different countries/regions around the world.
I speak Mandarin and English, and a bit of Korean and Japanese.
I'm a big animal lover and have two British Shorthair cats.
